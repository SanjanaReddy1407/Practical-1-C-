## Program to implement concept of class and object.

#Theory: Classes and Objects in C++
1. Class: A Class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit. In C++, classes are the core of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

2. Object: An Object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated; memory is only allocated when an object of that class is created.

3. Access Specifiers:

Public: Members are accessible from outside the class.

Private: Members can only be accessed by functions within the class. This is used for Data Hiding, a key part of encapsulation.

4. Member Functions: These are functions defined inside or outside the class that operate on the data members of the objects.

#Problem Statement 1
## Design and implement a program to demonstrate the concept of Class
and Object by creating a Student class.
The class should contain data members such as roll number, student
name, and marks obtained.
Define member functions to accept student details and display them in a
formatted manner.
Create objects for at least five students and invoke the member
functions using these objects.
